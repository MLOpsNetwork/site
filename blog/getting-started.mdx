# Getting Started with Devops Buildcamp

Welcome to your devops learning journey! This guide will help you get started with the Craftista learning app - a polyglot, microservices-based application designed specifically for learning devops through hands-on projects.

## Quick Start Options

You have two paths to begin:

1. **Demo Path (5 minutes)**: If you just want to try out the application quickly:
   - Visit [Craftista Demo](https://github.com/craftista/craftista-demo)
   - Follow the quick launch instructions

2. **Builder Path (Recommended)**: For the full learning experience:
   - Continue reading this guide
   - Build the project from scratch
   - Follow our structured learning path

## Understanding Craftista Architecture

Craftista consists of four main microservices:

1. **Frontend Service** (Node.js/Express.js)
   - Serves as the main UI
   - Routes and integrates with other services
   - Used by: Netflix, Uber, PayPal, LinkedIn

2. **Catalogue Service** (Python/Flask)
   - Manages origami showcase and details
   - Handles product data
   - Used by: Netflix, Reddit, Airbnb, LinkedIn

3. **Voting Service** (Java/Spring Boot)
   - Manages user voting functionality
   - Handles user interactions
   - Used by: Adobe, Microsoft, American Express

4. **Recommendation Service** (Golang)
   - Powers daily origami recommendations
   - Similar to services used by Google, Dropbox, Uber

## Getting Started with Development

### Prerequisites
- Git installed on your system
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerization)
- Basic understanding of microservices architecture
- Your favorite code editor

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/craftista/craftista
cd craftista

# View project structure
tree .
```

## Learning Path

Here's a recommended progression for building your devops skills:

### 1. Basic Projects
1. **Containerization**
   - Write Dockerfiles for each service
   - Create docker-compose for local development

2. **CI Pipeline**
   - Set up Jenkins or GitHub Actions
   - Implement automated testing

3. **Kubernetes Deployment**
   - Create basic K8s manifests
   - Deploy services to a cluster

### 2. Intermediate Projects
4. **Helm Packaging**
   - Create Helm charts
   - Handle multi-environment deployments

5. **GitOps with ArgoCD**
   - Implement blue/green deployments
   - Set up canary releases

6. **Observability**
   - Configure Prometheus & Grafana
   - Set up ELK/EFK stack

### 3. Advanced Projects
7. **Cloud Infrastructure**
   - Design HA architecture
   - Implement auto-scaling

8. **Service Mesh**
   - Deploy Istio
   - Configure traffic management

9. **Security**
   - Implement DevSecOps pipeline
   - Add security scanning

## Feedback and Progress Monitoring

Craftista provides several ways to monitor your progress:

1. **System Info Dashboard**
   - Container status
   - Kubernetes cluster info
   - Load balancer validation

2. **Version Tracking**
   - Visual version indicators
   - Deployment validation

3. **Service Status**
   - Real-time backend service status
   - API health monitoring

## Getting Help

1. Check the [documentation](https://github.com/craftista)
2. Join our [community](https://schoolofdevops.com)
3. Explore the [Devops Mastery System](https://schoolofdevops.com/#why)

## Next Steps

1. Choose your starting project from the learning path
2. Set up your local development environment
3. Begin with containerizing the application

Remember: The journey to devops mastery is iterative. Start small, build incrementally, and keep learning!
