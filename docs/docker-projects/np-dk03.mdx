# NP-DK03: Build Image for Go App

:::tip Project Overview
Develop a container image for a Go-based recommendation service, leveraging Go's static binary compilation and minimal container footprint.
:::

## Service Details
```go title="Service Configuration"
{
    "path": "/recommendation",
    "language": "Go",
    "framework": "Native Go",
    "port": 8080,
    "build": "go build -o app",
    "launch": "./app"
}
```

## Technical Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed locally
- Git for version control
- Basic Go knowledge
- IDE or text editor
- GitHub account

### Implementation Requirements

#### ðŸš€ Go-Specific Considerations
- Static binary compilation
- Go modules management
- Multi-stage build optimization
- Small base image selection

#### ðŸ”’ Security Measures
- Minimal base image (scratch/alpine)
- Non-root user execution
- Least privilege principle
- Security scanning integration

#### âš¡ Optimization Requirements
- Multi-stage build for minimal size
- Go build flags optimization
- Layer caching strategy
- Final binary optimization

:::warning Important Considerations
- Static linking considerations
- CGO dependencies handling
- Cross-compilation options
- Development workflow
:::

## Community Learning

### Weekly Schedule
- Monday: New project release
- Thursday: Live Build Session on [YouTube Channel Link]
  - Go containerization demo
  - Best practices discussion
  - Interactive Q&A

### Share Your Work
Join the learning community on r/devopsbuilders:
- Use "Devops Buildcamp" flair
- Include PR-DK03 in post title
- Share your approach
- Discuss Go containerization
- Help others learn

:::note Remember
Share your Go containerization journey with the community!
:::

## Reference Commands

```bash title="Build & Run Commands"
# Build the application
go build -o app

# Launch the application
./app

# Default port
8080
```

## Best Practices Implementation Guide

### Go Container Setup
```dockerfile title="Example Multi-Stage Structure"
# Build stage
FROM golang:1.19 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY go.* ./
RUN go mod download
COPY . .
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -o app

# Production stage
FROM scratch
COPY --from=builder /app/app /app
USER nobody
ENTRYPOINT ["/app"]
```

:::tip Pro Tip
Go's ability to create static binaries makes it perfect for creating ultra-small container images!
