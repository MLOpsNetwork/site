# PR-DK04: Build Image for Springboot App

:::tip Project Overview
Create an optimized container image for a Java Spring Boot voting service, focusing on JVM optimization and efficient resource utilization.
:::

## Service Details
```java title="Service Configuration"
{
    "path": "/voting",
    "language": "Java",
    "framework": "Spring Boot",
    "port": 8080,
    "build": "mvn package",
    "launch": ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
}
```

## Technical Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed locally
- Git for version control
- Basic Java/Spring knowledge
- Maven understanding
- IDE or text editor
- GitHub account

### Implementation Requirements

#### â˜• Java-Specific Considerations
- JVM optimization settings
- Spring Boot configuration
- Maven dependency management
- JAR file handling

#### ðŸ”’ Security Measures
- Minimal JRE base image
- Non-root user execution
- Secure dependency management
- Spring Security configuration

#### âš¡ Optimization Requirements
- Multi-stage build implementation
- Maven dependency caching
- Layer optimization
- JVM tuning parameters

:::warning Important Considerations
- Spring profiles configuration
- Environment variables handling
- Health check implementation
- Development workflow setup
:::

## Community Learning

### Weekly Schedule
- Monday: New project release
- Thursday: Live Build Session on [YouTube Channel Link]
  - Java containerization demo
  - Spring Boot best practices
  - Interactive Q&A

### Share Your Work
Join the learning community on r/devopsbuilders:
- Use "Devops Buildcamp" flair
- Include PR-DK04 in post title
- Share your approach
- Discuss Java containerization
- Help others learn

:::note Remember
Share your Java containerization insights and learn from the community!

## Reference Commands

```bash title="Build & Run Commands"
# Build the application
mvn package

# Launch the application
java -jar app.jar

# Default port
8080
```

## Best Practices Implementation Guide

### Java Container Setup
```dockerfile title="Example Multi-Stage Structure"
# Build stage
FROM maven:3.8.4-openjdk-17 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY pom.xml .
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline
COPY src ./src
RUN mvn package -DskipTests

# Production stage
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/target/*.jar app.jar
USER nobody
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

:::tip Pro Tip
Remember to optimize your JVM settings and Spring Boot configuration for containerized environments!
