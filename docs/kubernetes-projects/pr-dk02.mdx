# PR-DK02: Build Image for a Python App

:::tip Project Overview
Create an optimized container image for a Python Flask-based catalogue service, focusing on Python-specific best practices and efficient dependency management.
:::

## Service Details
```python title="Service Configuration"
{
    "path": "/catalogue",
    "language": "Python",
    "framework": "Flask",
    "port": 5000,
    "build": "pip install -r requirements.txt",
    "launch": ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]
}
```

## Technical Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed locally
- Git for version control
- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of Flask
- IDE or text editor
- GitHub account

### Implementation Requirements

#### üêç Python-Specific Considerations
- Virtual environment handling
- Package dependency management
- Gunicorn configuration
- Flask development vs production

#### üîí Security Measures
- Use minimal Python base image
- Run as non-root user
- Implement least privilege
- Secure dependency management

#### ‚ö° Optimization Requirements
- Multi-stage build implementation
- Python package caching
- Layer optimization
- Final image size reduction

:::warning Important Considerations
- Handle Python environment variables
- Configure Gunicorn properly
- Implement health checks
- Consider development workflow
:::

## Community Learning

### Weekly Schedule
- Monday: New project release
- Thursday: Live Build Session on [YouTube Channel Link]
  - Python containerization demo
  - Flask-specific practices
  - Interactive problem-solving

### Share Your Work
Join the learning community on r/devopsbuilders:
- Use "Devops Buildcamp" flair
- Include PR-DK02 in post title
- Share your approach
- Discuss Python containerization
- Help others learn

:::note Remember
This is about learning together - share your experiences and learn from others!

## Reference Commands

```bash title="Build & Run Commands"
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch with Gunicorn
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app

# Default port
5000
```

## Best Practices Implementation Guide

### Python Container Setup
```dockerfile title="Example Multi-Stage Structure"
# Build stage
FROM python:3.9 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --user -r requirements.txt

# Production stage
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /root/.local /root/.local
COPY . .
ENV PATH=/root/.local/bin:$PATH
USER nobody
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]
```

:::tip Pro Tip
When working with Python containers, pay special attention to the virtual environment and dependency management!
